'''In Insertion sorting algorithm we compare the element like compare the current indexed element with the previous elements and if previous element is greater than
the current indexed element exchange them, repeat this process until j>0 otherwise break the inner while loop and repeat the same process for rest of the elements
in the array. Time complexity of Insertion Sort in best case is Î©(n) and in the worst case is O(n^2)'''
